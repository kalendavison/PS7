#For this problem set, you will need to use dplyr and ggplot2 R packages to summarize a given dataset and create an appropriate visualization. You will
#have to only use the functions within dplyr (ex. filter(),select(),summarise(), and mutate()) and pipe operator (%>%) to work with data. Please complete
#the following tasks in order:
 # 1. Go to this link and download March2018 crime dataset: http://www. slmpd.org/Crimereports.shtml
#2. Compute the number of crime per day by the type of crime (Hint: clean Description variable and use it). Which types of crime happened the most in March?
#3. Compute the number of crime per day by neighborhood. Which neigh- borhood has the most number of crime?

#4. Compute the proportion of crime related to robbery by district. Which district has the largest proportion of crime related to robbery?
#5. Visualize changes of all types of crime over time using ggplot2. Write appropriate labels and titles.
#6. Visualize changes of all types of crime over time by district using ggplot2. Choose different color to indicate each district. Write ap- propriate legend, labels and titles.
